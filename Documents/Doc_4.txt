Python Tuples
A comma-separated group of items is called a Python triple. The ordering, settled items, and reiterations of a tuple are to some degree like those of a rundown, but in contrast to a rundown, a tuple is unchanging.

The main difference between the two is that we cannot alter the components of a tuple once they have been assigned. On the other hand, we can edit the contents of a list.

Example

("Suzuki", "Audi", "BMW"," Skoda ") is a tuple.  
Features of Python Tuple

Any number of items, including those with various data types (dictionary, string, float, list, etc.), can be contained in a tuple.

Code

# Python program to show how to create a tuple    
# Creating an empty tuple    
empty_tuple = ()    
print("Empty tuple: ", empty_tuple)    
    
# Creating tuple having integers    
int_tuple = (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14)    
print("Tuple with integers: ", int_tuple)    
    
# Creating a tuple having objects of different data types    
mixed_tuple = (4, "Python", 9.3)    
print("Tuple with different data types: ", mixed_tuple)    
    
# Creating a nested tuple    
nested_tuple = ("Python", {4: 5, 6: 2, 8:2}, (5, 3, 5, 6))    
print("A nested tuple: ", nested_tuple)    
Output:

Empty tuple: ()
Tuple with integers: (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14)
Tuple with different data types: (4, 'Python', 9.3)
A nested tuple: ('Python', {4: 5, 6: 2, 8: 2}, (5, 3, 5, 6))
Parentheses are not necessary for the construction of multiples. This is known as triple pressing.
