Python Literals
Python Literals can be defined as data that is given in a variable or constant.

Python supports the following literals:

1. String literals:
String literals can be formed by enclosing a text in the quotes. We can use both single as well as double quotes to create a string.

Example:

"Aman" , '12345'  
Types of Strings:

There are two types of Strings supported in Python:

a) Single-line String- Strings that are terminated within a single-line are known as Single line Strings.

Example:

text1='hello'  
b) Multi-line String - A piece of text that is written in multiple lines is known as multiple lines string.

There are two ways to create multiline strings:
