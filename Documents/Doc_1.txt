Python Variables: A variable is the name given to a memory location. A value-holding Python variable is also known as an identifier.Since Python is an infer language that is smart enough to determine the type of a variable, we do not need to specify its type in Python.

Variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore, but they can be a group of both letters and digits.

Identifier Naming
Identifiers are things like variables. An Identifier is utilized to recognize the literals utilized in the program

print("John")  
Output:

John
The Python object makes a integer object and shows it to the control center. We have created a string object in the print statement above. Make use of the built-in type() function in Python to determine its type.

type("John")  
Output:

In Python, factors are an symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an item. The factors are utilized to indicate objects by that name.

Let's understand the following example

a = 50   

Python Variables
In the above image, the variable a refers to an integer object.

Suppose we assign the integer value 50 to a new variable b.

a = 50  
b = a  

Python Variables
The variable b refers to the same object that a points to because Python does not create another object.

Let's assign the new value to b. Now both variables will refer to the different objects.
a = 50  
b = a  
print(id(a))  
print(id(b))  
# Reassigned variable a  
a = 500  
print(id(a))  
Output:

140734982691168
140734982691168
2822056960944
We assigned the b = a, an and b both highlight a similar item. The id() function that we used to check returned the same number. 
name = "A"  
Name = "B"  
naMe = "C"  
NAME = "D"  
n_a_m_e = "E"  
_name = "F"  
name_ = "G"  
_name_ = "H"  
na56me = "I"  
  
print(name,Name,naMe,NAME,n_a_m_e, NAME, n_a_m_e, _name, name_,_name, na56me)  
Output:

We can apply different tasks in two ways, either by relegating a solitary worth to various factors or doling out numerous qualities to different factors. Take a look at the following example.
